## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ npm install -g @nestjs/mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.

# NestJS Microservices Architecture with Kafka

This project demonstrates a microservices architecture using NestJS and Apache Kafka as a message broker. It consists of 4 applications:

1. **API Gateway (nest-app)**: The entry point for clients that forwards requests to appropriate microservices.
2. **User Service (app-1)**: Handles user-related operations.
3. **Product Service (app-2)**: Handles product-related operations.
4. **Order Service (app-3)**: Handles order-related operations.

## Architecture Overview

- **Communication Pattern**: Message-based communication using Kafka
- **API Gateway Pattern**: Single entry point for all clients
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Services separated by business domain
- **Apache Kafka**: Official Confluent images for Kafka and Zookeeper

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- Yarn or npm
- Docker and Docker Compose (for Kafka)

## Getting Started

1. **Start Kafka and Zookeeper**:

```bash
npm run kafka:up
```

For more details on working with Kafka, see [KAFKA.md](KAFKA.md).

2. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
yarn install
```

3. **Start all services**:

```bash
yarn start:all
```

Or start services individually:

```bash
# Start API Gateway
yarn start:dev

# Start User Service
yarn start:dev:app1

# Start Product Service
yarn start:dev:app2

# Start Order Service
yarn start:dev:app3
```

## API Endpoints

### User Service

- `GET /users` - Get all users
- `GET /users/:id` - Get a specific user
- `POST /users` - Create a new user
- `PUT /users/:id` - Update a user
- `DELETE /users/:id` - Delete a user

### Product Service

- `GET /products` - Get all products
- `GET /products/:id` - Get a specific product
- `GET /products/search` - Search products with filters
- `POST /products` - Create a new product
- `PUT /products/:id` - Update a product
- `DELETE /products/:id` - Delete a product

### Order Service

- `GET /orders` - Get all orders
- `GET /orders/:id` - Get a specific order
- `GET /users/:userId/orders` - Get all orders for a user
- `POST /orders` - Create a new order
- `PUT /orders/:id` - Update an order
- `DELETE /orders/:id` - Delete an order

## Architecture Principles

This project follows these microservices principles:

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each service handles a specific business capability
2. **Autonomy**: Services can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently
3. **Resilience**: Failures in one service don't cascade to others
4. **Asynchronous Communication**: Using Kafka for service-to-service communication
5. **API Gateway**: Simplified client experience with a single entry point

## Monitoring

Access the Kafka UI at http://localhost:8080 to monitor Kafka topics and messages.

## Implementation Details

- **Transport Layer**: Kafka
- **Message Patterns**: Request-Response via message patterns
- **Data Storage**: In-memory storage (for demo purposes)
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling at API Gateway

## Further Improvements

- Add authentication and authorization
- Implement database persistence
- Add service discovery
- Add distributed tracing
- Implement circuit breakers
- Add caching
- Implement health checks
